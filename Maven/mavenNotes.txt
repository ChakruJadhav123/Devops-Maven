Maven:
its a build tool
main file is POM.XML(Consit enitre information about project)
POM.XML will have entire information of project.
It is sued to create artifact(final product)(war,jar,ear)
It is mostly used for java-based projects.
It was initially released on 13 July 2004
Maven is wriiten in java(1.8.0)


RAW : .java (we can use it)
.java --> compile --> .class --> .jar

.class : which can be executable
.jar   : group of .class files (works for backend)
.war   : it has frontend and backend code .
libs   : its a pre defined package used for code.

Artifacts : It is final product
JAR  = Java Archive
WAR  = Web Archive
EAR  = Enterprise Archive

Architecture:
yum install git java-1.9.0-openjdk maven tree -y
git clone "git repo of project"
cd "projectfile"

Plugin : Its a small software which automaets our work.
with the plugins we can use tools without installing them.

Goal: its a command to perform task.

Maven follows a lifecycle

mvn compile   : to compile the source code
mvn test      : to test the code
mvn package   : to create artifact (poject directory)
mvn install   : to create artifact (maven home dir .m2)
mvn clean package : to perform entire goals
mvn clean     : to delete target
